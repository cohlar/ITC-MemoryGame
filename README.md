# ITC-Week5-MemoryGame
This project was an assignment at Israel Tech Challenge 5 weeks into the fullstack development bootcamp, to develop a mobile-responsive memory game using Javascript.
I chose to leverage jQuery, and made two different themes for the game (you have to win once to unlock the second theme).
The GIFs on the Win and Lose modals are generated randomly through an AJAX call to the Giphy API.
